# Pomodoro

A pomodoro application using tkinter. Day 28 Python Bootcamp


## Usage
The original technique has six steps:

**1.** Decide on the task to be done.
**2.** Set the pomodoro timer (typically for 25 minutes).
**3.** Work on the task.
**4.** End work when the timer rings and take a short break (typically 5â€“10
minutes).
**5.** If you have fewer than three pomodoros, go back to Step 2 and repeat
until you go through all three pomodoros.
**6.** After three pomodoros are done, take the fourth pomodoro and then take a
long break (traditionally 20 to 30 minutes). Once the long break is finished,
return to step 2.
